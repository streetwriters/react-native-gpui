# @react-native-gpui/gesture-handler

Desktop support for [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler): gestures from the mouse, trackpad and touch screen.

Part of [react-native-gpui](https://github.com/streetwriters/react-native-gpui), React Native for macOS, Windows and Linux.

## Install

Install it next to `react-native-gesture-handler`:

```sh
npm install react-native-gesture-handler@3.3.x @react-native-gpui/gesture-handler
```

Gesture Handler needs Reanimated 4.7.x and Worklets 0.13.x, with their desktop packages [`@react-native-gpui/reanimated`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-gpui/reanimated) and [`@react-native-gpui/worklets`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-gpui/worklets).

Keep using `react-native-gesture-handler` as you do on iOS and Android; its JavaScript API is unchanged. Autolinking builds the desktop side when the app is built.
